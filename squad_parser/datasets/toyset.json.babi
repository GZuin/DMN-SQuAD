1 Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season's playoffs, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach.
2 Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.
3 Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions.
4 In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot.
5 He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season.
6 Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.
7 Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records.
8 With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.

1 The flora of the city may be considered very rich in species.

1 In 1939, c. 1,300,000 people lived in Warsaw, but in 1945 – only 420,000.
2 During the first years after the war, the population growth was c. 6%, so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses.
3 The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years.
4 It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital.
5 Unfortunately this belief still lives on in Poland (although not as much as it used to be) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore.

1 Throughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city.
2 According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2% were Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants.
3 Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%).
4 This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town.
5 Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.
6 After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt.

1 The basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (gmina).
2 A city is also a commune – but with the city charter.
3 Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor – but in the communes the mayor is vogt (wójt in Polish), however in the cities – burmistrz.
4 Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e.
5 tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats.
6 An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e.
7 a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina).
8 In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki.
9 Such cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań.
10 In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration.
11 For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursynów).
12 But for instance the districts in Kraków do not have entitlements of powiat, so the registration numbers in Kraków are of the same type for all districts.
13 What is the basic unit of territorial division in Poland?	a commune 	1
14 What is the second level of territorial division in Poland?	counties or powiats 	5
15 In what districts are the registration numbers for cars all of the same type?	Kraków 	12
