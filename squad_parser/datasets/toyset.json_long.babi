1 Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.
2 The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title.
3 The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California.
4 As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.
6 The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP).
7 They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995.
8 The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, and denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game.
9 They joined the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.
11 The Broncos took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed.
12 Newton was limited by Denver's defense, which sacked him seven times and forced him into three turnovers, including a fumble which they recovered for a touchdown.
13 Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP, recording five solo tackles, 2½ sacks, and two forced fumbles.
15 CBS broadcast Super Bowl 50 in the U.S., and charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.
16 The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by the British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows, respectively.
17 It was the third-most watched U.S. broadcast ever.
19 In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and that it would be "an important game for us as a league".
21 The league eventually narrowed the bids to three sites: New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami's Sun Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area's Levi's Stadium.
23 The league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium and Levi's Stadium.
24 The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010.
25 The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985 (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home team 49ers.
26 The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
27 However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami's chances.
29 On May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded the game to Levi's Stadium.
30 The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014.
31 It is the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San Diego in 2003.
33 For the third straight season, the number one seeds from both conferences met in the Super Bowl.
34 The Carolina Panthers became one of only ten teams to have completed a regular season with only one loss, and one of only six teams to have acquired a 15–1 record, while the Denver Broncos became one of four teams to have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.
35 The Broncos made their second Super Bowl appearance in three years, having reached Super Bowl XLVIII, while the Panthers made their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, their other appearance being Super Bowl XXXVIII.
36 Coincidentally, both teams were coached by John Fox in their last Super Bowl appearance prior to Super Bowl 50.
38 Despite waiving longtime running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978.
39 Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers.
40 With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history.
41 Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.
43 The Panthers offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections.
44 Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636, while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing, 10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4.
45 Newton's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards.
46 Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards).
47 The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert, who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards.
48 Carolina's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner.
50 The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections.
51 Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two.
52 Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks.
53 The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL's active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts.
54 Behind them, two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly.
55 Davis compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes of his own.
56 Carolina's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns.
58 Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season's playoffs, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach.
59 Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.
60 Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions.
61 In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot.
62 He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season.
63 Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.
64 Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records.
65 With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.
67 Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.
68 In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4.
69 Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts.
70 Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards.
71 Running back C. J. Anderson was the team's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards.
72 Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.7 yards per carry average.
73 Overall, the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.
75 The Broncos' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296).
76 Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks.
77 Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three.
78 Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks.
79 Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102.
80 Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris Harris, Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense.
82 The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a year earlier.
83 The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.
85 The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16, by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game.
86 They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, 20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock.
87 Despite Manning's problems with interceptions during the season, he didn't throw any in their two playoff games.
89 Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game.
90 Despite this, he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl.
91 His prediction turned out to be accurate.
93 Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls.
94 He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39.
95 The past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager.
97 This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes.
98 Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011.
99 The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver.
100 Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26).
102 With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves.
104 Concerns were raised over whether Levi's Stadium's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any major issues since.
105 As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf.
106 NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in "great shape" for gameday.
107 However, the turf showed problem throughout the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game.
109 As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.
110 Elway stated, "We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms."
111 The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19.
112 In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color at the time.
113 They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII.
114 The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior.
115 The Broncos' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.
117 The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott.
118 The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.
120 On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V, would be temporarily suspended, and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI.
121 Jaime Weston, the league's vice president of brand and creative, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter "L" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV.
122 The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.
124 Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the "Golden Super Bowl"; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL's properties and painted on fields, the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos.
125 Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming" events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.
127 The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
128 In addition, "Super Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero, featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area's technology, culinary creations, and cultural diversity.
129 More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week.
130 San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area "they are going to have to leave".
131 San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $5 million.
133 In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.
134 A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors, but still may need the city council to help fund the event.
135 Additional funding will be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event.
137 The game's media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night.
138 The event was held on February 1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose.
139 Alongside the traditional media availabilities, the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.
141 For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl.
142 The host committee has already raised over $40 million through sponsors including Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.
144 The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl ever", and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area.
145 The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community investment and sustainable environments.
147 In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive, the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large, 18-karat gold-plated "50".
148 Each digit will weigh 33 lb (15 kg) for a total of 66 lb (30 kg).
149 Like the Lombardi Trophy, the "50" will be designed by Tiffany & Co.
151 In the United States, the game was televised by CBS, as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL.
152 The network's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines.
153 CBS introduced new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and "bullet time" effects.
154 (An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution.)
156 On December 28, 2015, ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game, marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl.
157 Unlike NBC and Fox, CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game (though per league policy, a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers).
158 The game was called by ESPN Deportes' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe.
159 ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike.
161 CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku).
162 Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.
163 The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN.
165 As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game.
166 Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden.
168 CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record high price for a Super Bowl ad.
169 As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet sold out.
170 CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast.
171 This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount.
172 It was also the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game.
173 Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut, promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise.
175 QuickBooks sponsored a "Small Business Big Game" contest, in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks.
176 Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement.
178 20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl.
179 Fox paid for Deadpool, X-Men: Apocalypse, Independence Day: Resurgence and Eddie the Eagle, Lionsgate paid for Gods of Egypt, Paramount paid for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows and 10 Cloverfield Lane, Universal paid for The Secret Life of Pets and the debut trailer for Jason Bourne and Disney paid for Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book and Alice Through the Looking Glass.

182 Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters.
183 Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage.
185 The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls.
186 In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) will carry the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
187 In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) will carry the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary.
188 WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), which is based in Chester, South Carolina.
189 As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern United States throughout the game (for Carolina).
190 In accordance with contractual rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all.
192 In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra will carry the contest.
193 The BBC will carry its own British English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.
195 In honor of the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players.
196 Bart Starr (MVP of Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared via video, while Peyton Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game.
197 No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, who died in 2001.
199 Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem, while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language (ASL) translation.
201 In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple acts" would perform during the halftime show.
202 On December 3, the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay.
203 On January 7, 2016, Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single "Hymn for the Weekend", would be making an appearance.
204 Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, and Mark Ronson also performed.
206 Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell.
207 A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina's defense dug in over the next three plays.
208 First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
209 Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal.
210 The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit.
212 After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge.
213 CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete.
214 A few plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton's hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead.
215 This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.
217 After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring drive.
218 Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter.
219 Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch.
220 Norwood had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line.
221 Despite Denver's excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.
223 On Carolina's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line.
224 However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock.
225 The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt.
226 After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line.
227 But with 11 seconds left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half.
229 The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play.
230 But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt.
231 After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead.
232 Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown.
233 But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J.
234 Ward.
235 Ward fumbled the ball during the return, but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession.
237 There would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line.
238 On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line.
239 A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano's 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10.
240 The next three drives of the game would end in punts.
242 With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9.
243 On the next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line.
244 Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it, Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism.
245 Meanwhile, Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs.
246 Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away.
247 Carolina had two more drives, but failed to get a first down on each one.

276 One of the most famous people born in Warsaw was Maria Skłodowska-Curie, who achieved international recognition for her research on radioactivity and was the first female recipient of the Nobel Prize.
277 Famous musicians include Władysław Szpilman and Frédéric Chopin.
278 Though Chopin was born in the village of Żelazowa Wola, about 60 km (37 mi) from Warsaw, he moved to the city with his family when he was seven months old.
279 Casimir Pulaski, a Polish general and hero of the American Revolutionary War, was born here in 1745.
281 The Saxon Garden, covering the area of 15.5 ha, was formally a royal garden.
282 There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax.
283 At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated.
284 In the 19th century the Krasiński Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior.
285 Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees.
286 With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasiński Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians.
287 The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here.
288 The Łazienki Park covers the area of 76 ha.
289 The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes).
290 What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond.
291 The Wilanów Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century.
292 It covers the area of 43 ha.
293 Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace.
294 The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond.
295 The park around the Królikarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula.
296 The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.
298 There are 13 natural reserves in Warsaw – among others, Bielany Forest, Kabaty Woods, Czerniaków Lake.
299 About 15 kilometres (9 miles) from Warsaw, the Vistula river's environment changes strikingly and features a perfectly preserved ecosystem, with a habitat of animals that includes the otter, beaver and hundreds of bird species.
300 There are also several lakes in Warsaw – mainly the oxbow lakes, like Czerniaków Lake, the lakes in the Łazienki or Wilanów Parks, Kamionek Lake.
301 There are lot of small lakes in the parks, but only a few are permanent – the majority are emptied before winter to clean them of plants and sediments.
303 Demographically, it was the most diverse city in Poland, with significant numbers of foreign-born inhabitants.
304 In addition to the Polish majority, there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw.
305 According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (around 34% percent).
306 Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city's total population.
307 In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue.
308 World War II changed the demographics of the city, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history.
309 Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation.
311 The University of Warsaw was established in 1816, when the partitions of Poland separated Warsaw from the oldest and most influential Polish academic center, in Kraków.
312 Warsaw University of Technology is the second academic school of technology in the country, and one of the largest in East-Central Europe, employing 2,000 professors.

316 The building was designed by architects Marek Budzyński and Zbigniew Badowski and opened on 15 December 1999.
317 It is surrounded by green.
318 The University Library garden, designed by Irena Bajerska, was opened on 12 June 2002.
319 It is one of the largest and most beautiful roof gardens in Europe with an area of more than 10,000 m2 (107,639.10 sq ft), and plants covering 5,111 m2 (55,014.35 sq ft).
320 As the university garden it is open to the public every day.
322 Like many cities in Central and Eastern Europe, infrastructure in Warsaw suffered considerably during its time as an Eastern Bloc economy – though it is worth mentioning that the initial Three-Year Plan to rebuild Poland (especially Warsaw) was a major success, but what followed was very much the opposite.
323 However, over the past decade Warsaw has seen many improvements due to solid economic growth, an increase in foreign investment as well as funding from the European Union.
324 In particular, the city's metro, roads, sidewalks, health care facilities and sanitation facilities have improved markedly.
326 Today, Warsaw has some of the best medical facilities in Poland and East-Central Europe.
327 The city is home to the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI), the highest-reference hospital in all of Poland, as well as an active research and education center.
328 While the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology it is one of the largest and most modern oncological institutions in Europe.
329 The clinical section is located in a 10-floor building with 700 beds, 10 operating theatres, an intensive care unit, several diagnostic departments as well as an outpatient clinic.
330 The infrastructure has developed a lot over the past years.
332 Thanks to numerous musical venues, including the Teatr Wielki, the Polish National Opera, the Chamber Opera, the National Philharmonic Hall and the National Theatre, as well as the Roma and Buffo music theatres and the Congress Hall in the Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw hosts many events and festivals.
333 Among the events worth particular attention are: the International Frédéric Chopin Piano Competition, the International Contemporary Music Festival Warsaw Autumn, the Jazz Jamboree, Warsaw Summer Jazz Days, the International Stanisław Moniuszko Vocal Competition, the Mozart Festival, and the Festival of Old Music.
335 Nearby, in Ogród Saski (the Saxon Garden), the Summer Theatre was in operation from 1870 to 1939, and in the inter-war period, the theatre complex also included Momus, Warsaw's first literary cabaret, and Leon Schiller's musical theatre Melodram.
336 The Wojciech Bogusławski Theatre (1922–26), was the best example of "Polish monumental theatre".
337 From the mid-1930s, the Great Theatre building housed the Upati Institute of Dramatic Arts – the first state-run academy of dramatic art, with an acting department and a stage directing department.
339 Several commemorative events take place every year.
340 Gatherings of thousands of people on the banks of the Vistula on Midsummer’s Night for a festival called Wianki (Polish for Wreaths) have become a tradition and a yearly event in the programme of cultural events in Warsaw.
341 The festival traces its roots to a peaceful pagan ritual where maidens would float their wreaths of herbs on the water to predict when they would be married, and to whom.
342 By the 19th century this tradition had become a festive event, and it continues today.
343 The city council organize concerts and other events.
344 Each Midsummer’s Eve, apart from the official floating of wreaths, jumping over fires, looking for the fern flower, there are musical performances, dignitaries' speeches, fairs and fireworks by the river bank.
346 As interesting examples of expositions the most notable are: the world's first Museum of Posters boasting one of the largest collections of art posters in the world, Museum of Hunting and Riding and the Railway Museum.
347 From among Warsaw's 60 museums, the most prestigious ones are National Museum with a collection of works whose origin ranges in time from antiquity till the present epoch as well as one of the best collections of paintings in the country including some paintings from Adolf Hitler's private collection, and Museum of the Polish Army whose set portrays the history of arms.
349 A fine tribute to the fall of Warsaw and history of Poland can be found in the Warsaw Uprising Museum and in the Katyń Museum which preserves the memory of the crime.
350 The Warsaw Uprising Museum also operates a rare preserved and operating historic stereoscopic theatre, the Warsaw Fotoplastikon.
351 The Museum of Independence preserves patriotic and political objects connected with Poland's struggles for independence.
352 Dating back to 1936 Warsaw Historical Museum contains 60 rooms which host a permanent exhibition of the history of Warsaw from its origins until today.

361 Polonia's home venue is located at Konwiktorska Street, a ten-minute walk north from the Old Town.
362 Polonia was relegated from the country's top flight in 2013 because of their disastrous financial situation.
363 They are now playing in the 4th league (5th tier in Poland) -the bottom professional league in the National – Polish Football Association (PZPN) structure.
365 The mermaid (syrenka) is Warsaw's symbol and can be found on statues throughout the city and on the city's coat of arms.
366 This imagery has been in use since at least the mid-14th century.
367 The oldest existing armed seal of Warsaw is from the year 1390, consisting of a round seal bordered with the Latin inscription Sigilium Civitatis Varsoviensis (Seal of the city of Warsaw).
368 City records as far back as 1609 document the use of a crude form of a sea monster with a female upper body and holding a sword in its claws.
369 In 1653 the poet Zygmunt Laukowski asks the question:
371 The origin of the legendary figure is not fully known.
372 The best-known legend, by Artur Oppman, is that long ago two of Triton's daughters set out on a journey through the depths of the oceans and seas.
373 One of them decided to stay on the coast of Denmark and can be seen sitting at the entrance to the port of Copenhagen.
374 The second mermaid reached the mouth of the Vistula River and plunged into its waters.
375 She stopped to rest on a sandy beach by the village of Warszowa, where fishermen came to admire her beauty and listen to her beautiful voice.
376 A greedy merchant also heard her songs; he followed the fishermen and captured the mermaid.
378 Tamara de Lempicka was a famous artist born in Warsaw.

384 Let me just write about it.
385 Let this Warsaw not disappear forever, he commented.
387 In 2012 the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Warsaw as the 32nd most liveable city in the world.
388 It was also ranked as one of the most liveable cities in Central Europe.
389 Today Warsaw is considered an "Alpha–" global city, a major international tourist destination and a significant cultural, political and economic hub.
390 Warsaw's economy, by a wide variety of industries, is characterised by FMCG manufacturing, metal processing, steel and electronic manufacturing and food processing.
391 The city is a significant centre of research and development, BPO, ITO, as well as of the Polish media industry.

397 The first historical reference to Warsaw dates back to the year 1313, at a time when Kraków served as the Polish capital city.
398 Due to its central location between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596.
399 After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia.
400 In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte.
401 In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the "Congress Kingdom".
402 Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland.
403 The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944.
404 Warsaw gained the title of the "Phoenix City" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history.
405 Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings.
406 On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).
408 The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese (left bank of the Vistula) and diocese (right bank), and possesses various universities, most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw, two opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries and monuments.
409 The historic city-centre of Warsaw with its picturesque Old Town in 1980 was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

411 Buildings represent examples of nearly every European architectural style and historical period.
412 Warsaw provides many examples of architecture from the gothic, renaissance, baroque and neoclassical periods, and around a quarter of the city is filled with luxurious parks and royal gardens.
414 Warsaw's name in the Polish language is Warszawa, approximately /vɑːrˈʃɑːvə/ (also formerly spelled Warszewa and Warszowa), meaning "belonging to Warsz", Warsz being a shortened form of the masculine name of Slavic origin Warcisław; see also etymology of Wrocław.
415 Folk etymology attributes the city name to a fisherman, Wars, and his wife, Sawa.
416 According to legend, Sawa was a mermaid living in the Vistula River with whom Wars fell in love.
417 In actuality, Warsz was a 12th/13th-century nobleman who owned a village located at the modern-day site of Mariensztat neighbourhood.
418 See also the Vršovci family which had escaped to Poland.
419 The official city name in full is miasto stołeczne Warszawa (English: "The Capital City of Warsaw").
420 A native or resident of Warsaw is known as a Varsovian – in Polish warszawiak (male), warszawianka (female), warszawiacy (plural).
422 The first fortified settlements on the site of today's Warsaw were located in Bródno (9th/10th century) and Jazdów (12th/13th century).
423 After Jazdów was raided by nearby clans and dukes, a new similar settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called Warszowa.
424 The Prince of Płock, Bolesław II of Masovia, established this settlement, the modern-day Warsaw, in about 1300.
425 In the beginning of the 14th century it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia, becoming the official capital of Masovian Duchy in 1413.
426 14th-century Warsaw's economy rested on mostly crafts and trade.
427 Upon the extinction of the local ducal line, the duchy was reincorporated into the Polish Crown in 1526.
429 In 1529, Warsaw for the first time became the seat of the General Sejm, permanent from 1569.
430 In 1573 the city gave its name to the Warsaw Confederation, formally establishing religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
431 Due to its central location between the Commonwealth's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596.
432 In the following years the town expanded towards the suburbs.
433 Several private independent districts were established, the property of aristocrats and the gentry, which were ruled by their own laws.
434 Three times between 1655–1658 the city was under siege and three times it was taken and pillaged by the Swedish, Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces.
436 Warsaw remained the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1796, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia to become the capital of the province of South Prussia.
437 Liberated by Napoleon's army in 1806, Warsaw was made the capital of the newly created Duchy of Warsaw.
438 Following the Congress of Vienna of 1815, Warsaw became the centre of the Congress Poland, a constitutional monarchy under a personal union with Imperial Russia.
439 The Royal University of Warsaw was established in 1816.
441 Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918.
442 The Allied Armistice terms required in Article 12 that Germany withdraw from areas controlled by Russia in 1914, which included Warsaw.
443 Germany did so, and underground leader Piłsudski returned to Warsaw on 11 November and set up what became the Second Polish Republic, with Warsaw the capital.
444 In the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920, the huge Battle of Warsaw was fought on the eastern outskirts of the city in which the capital was successfully defended and the Red Army defeated.
445 Poland stopped by itself the full brunt of the Red Army and defeated an idea of the "export of the revolution".
447 After the German Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 began the Second World War, Warsaw was defended till September 27.
448 Central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the General Government, a German Nazi colonial administration.
449 All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw's entire Jewish population – several hundred thousand, some 30% of the city – herded into the Warsaw Ghetto.
450 The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe.
451 When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler's "Final Solution" on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
452 Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the Ghetto held out for almost a month.
453 When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, with only a few managing to escape or hide.
455 By July 1944, the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Germans toward Warsaw.
456 Knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland, the Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived.
457 Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began.
458 The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours, was partially successful, however it went on for 63 days.
459 Eventually the Home Army fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate.
460 They were transported to PoW camps in Germany, while the entire civilian population was expelled.
461 Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.
463 After World War II, under a Communist regime set up by the conquering Soviets, the "Bricks for Warsaw" campaign was initiated, and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the housing shortage, along with other typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city, such as the Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet Union.
464 The city resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country's centre of political and economic life.
465 Many of the historic streets, buildings, and churches were restored to their original form.
466 In 1980, Warsaw's historic Old Town was inscribed onto UNESCO's World Heritage list.
468 John Paul II's visits to his native country in 1979 and 1983 brought support to the budding solidarity movement and encouraged the growing anti-communist fervor there.
469 In 1979, less than a year after becoming pope, John Paul celebrated Mass in Victory Square in Warsaw and ended his sermon with a call to "renew the face" of Poland: Let Thy Spirit descend!
470 Let Thy Spirit descend and renew the face of the land!
471 This land!
472 These words were very meaningful for the Polish citizens who understood them as the incentive for the democratic changes.
474 Warsaw lies in east-central Poland about 300 km (190 mi) from the Carpathian Mountains and about 260 km (160 mi) from the Baltic Sea, 523 km (325 mi) east of Berlin, Germany.
475 The city straddles the Vistula River.
476 It is located in the heartland of the Masovian Plain, and its average elevation is 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level.
477 The highest point on the left side of the city lies at a height of 115.7 metres (379.6 ft) ("Redutowa" bus depot, district of Wola), on the right side – 122.1 metres (400.6 ft) ("Groszówka" estate, district of Wesoła, by the eastern border).
478 The lowest point lies at a height 75.6 metres (248.0 ft) (at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw).
479 There are some hills (mostly artificial) located within the confines of the city – e.g.
480 Warsaw Uprising Hill (121 metres (397.0 ft)), Szczęśliwice hill (138 metres (452.8 ft) – the highest point of Warsaw in general).
482 Warsaw is located on two main geomorphologic formations: the plain moraine plateau and the Vistula Valley with its asymmetrical pattern of different terraces.
483 The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, which divides the city into two parts, left and right.
484 The left one is situated both on the moraine plateau (10 to 25 m (32.8 to 82.0 ft) above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max.
485 6.5 m (21.3 ft) above Vistula level).
486 The significant element of the relief, in this part of Warsaw, is the edge of moraine plateau called Warsaw Escarpment.
487 It is 20 to 25 m (65.6 to 82.0 ft) high in the Old Town and Central district and about 10 m (32.8 ft) in the north and south of Warsaw.
488 It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark.
490 The plain moraine plateau has only a few natural and artificial ponds and also groups of clay pits.
491 The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical.
492 The left side consist mainly of two levels: the highest one contains former flooded terraces and the lowest one the flood plain terrace.
493 The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground depressions with water systems coming from the Vistula old – riverbed.
494 They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches.
495 The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms.
496 There are several levels of the plain Vistula terraces (flooded as well as former flooded once) and only small part and not so visible moraine escarpment.
497 Aeolian sand with a number of dunes parted by peat swamps or small ponds cover the highest terrace.
498 These are mainly forested areas (pine forest).
500 Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country.
501 During the Second World War, Warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction.
502 After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled PRL.
503 Most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed.
504 However, some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g.
505 Leopold Kronenberg Palace).
506 Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries.
508 Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the burgher houses and fortifications.
509 The most significant buildings are St. John's Cathedral (14th century), the temple is a typical example of the so-called Masovian gothic style, St. Mary's Church (1411), a town house of Burbach family (14th century), Gunpowder Tower (after 1379) and the Royal Castle Curia Maior (1407–1410).
510 The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in the city are the house of Baryczko merchant family (1562), building called "The Negro" (early 17th century) and Salwator tenement (1632).
511 The most interesting examples of mannerist architecture are the Royal Castle (1596–1619) and the Jesuit Church (1609–1626) at Old Town.
512 Among the first structures of the early baroque the most important are St. Hyacinth's Church (1603–1639) and Sigismund's Column (1644).
514 Building activity occurred in numerous noble palaces and churches during the later decades of the 17th century.
515 One of the best examples of this architecture are Krasiński Palace (1677–1683), Wilanów Palace (1677–1696) and St. Kazimierz Church (1688–1692).
516 The most impressive examples of rococo architecture are Czapski Palace (1712–1721), Palace of the Four Winds (1730s) and Visitationist Church (façade 1728–1761).
517 The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period.
518 Some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the Palace on the Water (rebuilt 1775–1795), Królikarnia (1782–1786), Carmelite Church (façade 1761–1783) and Evangelical Holy Trinity Church (1777–1782).
519 The economic growth during the first years of Congress Poland caused a rapid rise architecture.
520 The Neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture, the most notable are the Great Theater (1825–1833) and buildings located at Bank Square (1825–1828).
522 Exceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the war (like mentioned Kronenberg Palace and Insurance Company Rosja building) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style (like Warsaw Philharmony edifice originally inspired by Palais Garnier in Paris).
523 Despite that the Warsaw University of Technology building (1899–1902) is the most interesting of the late 19th-century architecture.
524 Some 19th-century buildings in the Praga district (the Vistula’s right bank) have been restored although many have been poorly maintained.
525 Warsaw’s municipal government authorities have decided to rebuild the Saxon Palace and the Brühl Palace, the most distinctive buildings in prewar Warsaw.
527 There are also many places commemorating the heroic history of Warsaw.
528 Pawiak, an infamous German Gestapo prison now occupied by a Mausoleum of Memory of Martyrdom and the museum, is only the beginning of a walk in the traces of Heroic City.
529 The Warsaw Citadel, an impressive 19th-century fortification built after the defeat of the November Uprising, was a place of martyr for the Poles.
530 Another important monument, the statue of Little Insurgent located at the ramparts of the Old Town, commemorates the children who served as messengers and frontline troops in the Warsaw Uprising, while the impressive Warsaw Uprising Monument by Wincenty Kućma was erected in memory of the largest insurrection of World War II.
532 Other green spaces in the city include the Botanic Garden and the University Library garden.
533 They have extensive botanical collection of rare domestic and foreign plants, while a palm house in the New Orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world.
534 Besides, within the city borders, there are also: Pole Mokotowskie (a big park in the northern Mokotów, where was the first horse racetrack and then the airport), Park Ujazdowski (close to the Sejm and John Lennon street), Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin, by the southern city border, Park Skaryszewski by the right Vistula bank, in Praga.
535 The oldest park in Praga, the Praga Park, was established in 1865–1871 and designed by Jan Dobrowolski.
536 In 1927 a zoological garden (Ogród Zoologiczny) was established on the park grounds, and in 1952 a bear run, still open today.
538 The flora of the city may be considered very rich in species.
539 The species richness is mainly due to the location of Warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas (natural forests, wetlands along the Vistula) as well as arable land, meadows and forests.
540 Bielany Forest, located within the borders of Warsaw, is the remaining part of the Masovian Primeval Forest.
541 Bielany Forest nature reserve is connected with Kampinos Forest.
542 It is home to rich fauna and flora.
543 Within the forest there are three cycling and walking trails.
544 Other big forest area is Kabaty Forest by the southern city border.
545 Warsaw has also two botanic gardens: by the Łazienki park (a didactic-research unit of the University of Warsaw) as well as by the Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin (a unit of the Polish Academy of Science).
547 In 1939, c. 1,300,000 people lived in Warsaw, but in 1945 – only 420,000.
548 During the first years after the war, the population growth was c. 6%, so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses.
549 The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years.
550 It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital.
551 Unfortunately this belief still lives on in Poland (although not as much as it used to be) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore.
553 Throughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city.
554 According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2% were Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants.
555 Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%).
556 This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town.
557 Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.
558 After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt.
560 The basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (gmina).
561 A city is also a commune – but with the city charter.
562 Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor – but in the communes the mayor is vogt (wójt in Polish), however in the cities – burmistrz.
563 Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e.
564 tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats.
565 An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e.
566 a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina).
567 In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki.
568 Such cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań.
569 In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration.
570 For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursynów).
571 But for instance the districts in Kraków do not have entitlements of powiat, so the registration numbers in Kraków are of the same type for all districts.
573 Legislative power in Warsaw is vested in a unicameral Warsaw City Council (Rada Miasta), which comprises 60 members.
574 Council members are elected directly every four years.
575 Like most legislative bodies, the City Council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government.
576 Bills passed by a simple majority are sent to the mayor (the President of Warsaw), who may sign them into law.
577 If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote.
579 The mayor of Warsaw is called President.
580 Generally, in Poland, the mayors of bigger cities are called presidents – i.e.
581 such cities, which have over 100,000 people or these, where already was president before 1990.
582 The first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695–1696).
583 Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw Presidents was simultaneously the Warsaw Voivode.
584 Since 1990 the President of Warsaw had been elected by the City council.
585 In the years of 1994–1999 the mayor of the district Centrum automatically was designated as the President of Warsaw: the mayor of Centrum was elected by the district council of Centrum and the council was elected only by the Centrum residents.
586 Since 2002 the President of Warsaw is elected by all of the citizens of Warsaw.
588 Warsaw, especially its city centre (Śródmieście), is home not only to many national institutions and government agencies, but also to many domestic and international companies.
589 In 2006, 304,016 companies were registered in the city.
590 Warsaw's ever-growing business community has been noticed globally, regionally, and nationally.
591 MasterCard Emerging Market Index has noted Warsaw's economic strength and commercial center.
592 Moreover, Warsaw was ranked as the 7th greatest emerging market.
593 Foreign investors' financial participation in the city's development was estimated in 2002 at over 650 million euro.
594 Warsaw produces 12% of Poland's national income, which in 2008 was 305.1% of the Polish average, per capita (or 160% of the European Union average).
595 The GDP per capita in Warsaw amounted to PLN 94 000 in 2008 (c. EUR 23 800, USD 33 000).
596 Total nominal GDP of the city in 2010 amounted to 191.766 billion PLN, 111696 PLN per capita, which was 301,1 % of Polish average.
597 Warsaw leads the region of East-Central Europe in foreign investment and in 2006, GDP growth met expectations with a level of 6.1%.
598 It also has one of the fastest growing economies, with GDP growth at 6.5 percent in 2007 and 6.1 percent in the first quarter of 2008.
600 Warsaw's first stock exchange was established in 1817 and continued trading until World War II.
601 It was re-established in April 1991, following the end of the post-war communist control of the country and the reintroduction of a free-market economy.
602 Today, the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) is, according to many indicators, the largest market in the region, with 374 companies listed and total capitalization of 162 584 mln EUR as of 31 August 2009.
603 From 1991 until 2000, the stock exchange was, ironically, located in the building previously used as the headquarters of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR).
605 The FSO Car Factory was established in 1951.
606 A number of vehicles have been assembled there over the decades, including the Warszawa, Syrena, Fiat 125p (under license from Fiat, later renamed FSO 125p when the license expired) and the Polonez.
607 The last two models listed were also sent abroad and assembled in a number of other countries, including Egypt and Colombia.
608 In 1995 the factory was purchased by the South Korean car manufacturer Daewoo, which assembled the Tico, Espero, Nubia, Tacuma, Leganza, Lanos and Matiz there for the European market.
609 In 2005 the factory was sold to AvtoZAZ, a Ukrainian car manufacturer which assembled there the Chevrolet Aveo.
610 The license for the production of the Aveo expired in February 2011 and has since not been renewed.
611 Currently the company is defunct.
